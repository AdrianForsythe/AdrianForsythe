# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Adrian!

I am a Researcher at Uppsala University in the Department of Systematics, where my research focuses on identifying and annotating large repetitive elements in fungal pathogen genomes. I'm a member of the [FungAGE Lab](https://fungage.github.io/), where our research is focused on better understanding the incredible plasticity in fungal genomes. Right now, I am working on identifying genes that are involved with the movement and function of some extremely large transposable elements, the [Starships](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac109).
